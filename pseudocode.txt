Algorithm - Get Students below a certain threshhold based on the total marks
Description : - Get a list of students who are below a certain threshold by considering the total marks of the students.
Assumption : - We have an array of student total marks and a threshold mark

function getStudentsBelowThreshold():
threshold, students
// make an empty array to store the students below the threshold
    students_below_threshold= []

//loop through total marks results
    for i from 0 to length(students) - 1:

    //check if the student's total mark is below the threshold
        if (students[i].students_total_marks < threshold):

       // if the mark is below the threshold push it into the students below_cutmark array
            add students[i] to students_below_threshold
        end if
    // end the loop
    end for loop


//return the students below threshold mark array
    return students_below_threshold

Algorithm - Get Top 5 students
Description : - To get the top 5 students with the highest marks
Assumption : - We have an array list of students with their total marks

function getTop5Students():
//array list of students
    students

    //array to store top 5 students
    top_5_students = []

//organise the student data to get the students organised from the highest mark to the lowest
  //loop to get a student at a position
    for i from 0 to length(students) - 1:
    //loop to get a student at the next position
        for j from i + 1 to length(students) - 1:
        //compare the two students' total marks
        //if the total marks of the first of the two students is lower, swap the student positions
            if students[i].total_marks < student_results[j].total_marks):
                swap(students[i], students[j])
            end if
         end for
    end for

// loop to get the first five students
    count = 0

    //loop from 0 to 4 to get the first five students
    for i from count to 4:

    //add the students to the top_5_students array
        add students[i] to top_5_students

    end loop

    return top_5_students
