Algorithm - Get Students below a certain threshhold based on the total marks
Description : - Get a list of students who are below a certain threshold by considering the total marks of the students.
Assumption : - We have an array of student total marks and a threshold mark

function getStudentsBelowThreshold():
threshold, students
// make an empty array to store the students below the threshold
    students_below_threshold= []

//loop through total marks results
    for i from 0 to length(students) - 1:

    //check if the student's total mark is below the threshold
        if (students[i].students_total_marks < threshold):

       // if the mark is below the threshold push it into the students below_cutmark array
            add students[i] to students_below_threshold
        end if
    // end the loop
    end for loop


//return the students below threshold mark array
    return students_below_threshold
